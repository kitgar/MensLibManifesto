# A Manifesto for Men's Liberation
## 1. Preamble

### 1.1 Declaration

In the UK, suicide kills men aged 18 to 45 in greater numbers than any known disease. More than cancer or heart attacks. More than car crashes or hit-and-run. More than war or interpersonal violence. It is no exaggeration to call this an epidemic; a catastrophic self-decimation of young people on an almost unfathomable scale.

In 2016, men accounted for 4,508 deaths, 75% of all deaths by suicide (Office of National Statistics, 2017). Although this represents a slight decline on previous years (and the largest decline since 1995), any death by suicide that could have been prevented should be considered an affront to society at all levels.

**Recognising** the seriousness of this epidemic;

**Acknowledging** the valuable contributions to the understanding of this epidemic by our feminist counterparts and fellow-traveller men/male identifying comrades;

**Understanding** the mortal need to separate men from the toxic narratives of patriarchy and masculinity;

**We, the contributors to this project,** choose to confront, to understand, and to dismantle these ills by any means necessary, for the bettering of both men and society. In doing so we choose to employ feminist frameworks and methodologies, as they are the only ones available that accurately describe the world in which we live, while providing the tools necessary to effect real and lasting change.

### 1.2 Scope
This Manifesto provides a description of both **patriarchy** and **toxic masculinity**. It describes how these concepts, while historically used to ensure and secure the superiority in society of men over women, have come to have extremely negative influences on men and their emotional, social and intellectual development. It then proceeds to offer a set of solutions to the problems posed by these concepts based around the idea of **Men's Liberation** from them.

### 1.2.1 What the Manifesto Is Not
While our aims are ambitious, this Manifesto is **not a scholarly work**. You will not find long and critically reasoned debates between different schools of thought or page upon page of justification and evidence here; that is the domain of journals and books. Our purpose is to **describe what we see** and **provide a set of tools, maxims and methodologies to effect improvement** by **encouraging men to take responsibility for dismantling the systems their forebears have created** and passed on, in order to **free themselves and the rest of society from ideological tyranny**.

### 1.2.2 Commitment to Intersectionality
Assertions in 1.2.1 are **not an indication that we exclude any ally to - or stakeholder in - this cause of any (or no) gender**, but rather are intended to **shift the burden of labour of problem-solving onto those most responsible for the perpetuation of negative masculinities**. The Men's Liberation movement is an **intersectional, feminist movement** and as such welcomes allies, assistance and participation from persons of all backgrounds, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation or political affiliation.

### 1.3 Language and Translation

Every effort has been made to ensure this work is as widely accessible as possible; technical terms and jargon are avoided, and where they cannot be avoided they are thoroughly glossed in easy-to-understand language.

This Manifesto was first written in English, as it was the primary language of its first contributor. Translators are  sought to convert it to other languages; any person interested in joining the project as a translator should **fork the main branch, complete translation work for their language(s) and then issue a pull request** in order to have this work merged into the main branch. Each individual language should sit within its own subfolder of ``MensLibManifesto/Manifesto``. Preference is for entire files or large parts of files to be completed before merging into the main branch. Alternatively, completed translations of any sections can be emailed to kit@kitgarrett.com

### 1.4 License

While the Manifesto has its primary home on GitHub (for version control, transparency and contribution purposes), it is available in syndication throughout the web under the ``GNU GPLv3 License``. That means that you, or anyone, can do any of the following:
* Distribute it in public, including through a website, blog, Twitter feed or Facebook post.
* Modify it according to their needs or for other purposes.
* Exploit it for commercial purposes.
* Use it or modify it in private settings.

However, in doing any of these, you must do all of the following:
* **Release any copyright claim you may have** to contributions to the Manifesto. This is done to ensure that the License it uses remains valid; in order for the ``GNU GPLv3 License`` to be valid, a single person or entity must retain copyright over it. This **does not affect** your right to distribute, modify, use or commercially exploit the Manifesto.
* Provide the **full source of the original Manifesto** that your version is based on. In practical terms, this at a minimum involves including a link to this Repository (link to be added in next version).
* Include the **License type and Copyright declaration** included at ``MensLibManifesto/LICENSE`` and ``MensLibManifesto/COPYRIGHT``. In practical terms, this at a minimum means disclosing that the original document is **Copyright Kit Garrett, 2018**, and is distributed under the ``GNU GPLv3 License``, along with a link to https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/.
* **License any modifications** you make using the ``GNU GPLv3 License``. In practical terms, this means that you allow others to modify and distribute any version of this work (modified or unmodified) that you distribute. Essentially, it asks that you extend the same rights to others that we have extended to you.
* **Document clearly any changes you have made** (if any). This is to avoid the appearance that any modified version of the Manifesto stands in the stead of this one or otherwise misrepresents the consensus of its author(s).

It should be noted that **citing the Manifesto does not require any of the above**. You can quote from it at length, link to it, talk about it or otherwise use it in any work, academic or non-academic, without being bound by this License, **providing you do not modify it or distribute it in full**. Cite it as you would any other work.

Any concerns regarding licensing, no matter how trivial, should be raised with the Project Founder, Kit Garrett, via email (kit@kitgarrett.com) or Twitter (http://www.twitter.com/kitgender). I am always happy to address concerns over how to ethically use this document.

### 1.5 Living Document
The Manifesto for Men's Liberation is a **living document**. This means that it is changing and evolving all the time as thought around it and the issues it raises becomes clearer. As such, you should check back here regularly for the latest version. A full list of additions, removals and changes can be found in ``MensLibManifesto/README.md``

### 1.6 Recognising Contributors
Though contributors to the Manifesto release their individual copyright claims, they are invited to add their names to ``MensLibManifesto/CONTRIBUTORS.md``. This file, according to the License, must be distributed along with the Manifesto itself.
